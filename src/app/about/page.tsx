    I’m skilled in MS Word, and I enjoy using it to design detailed, high-quality booklets for schools,
     blending creativity with functionality. Additionally, I have a strong technical background in web 
     development, with expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js.
